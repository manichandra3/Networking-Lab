Program Outline
1. Initialization
    Input N: Number of stations prepared to transmit.
    Input Total Time Slots: The number of time slots to simulate.
    Constants:
        Slot Time: 51.2 Î¼s.
        Maximum Frame Length (standard Ethernet frame size).
        Collision Detection time: 1 slot.
2. Data Structures
    Status for Each Station:
        ready_to_send[]: A boolean array to track if a station is ready to send a frame.
        waiting_time[]: Array to track when each station is waiting for its transmission.
        successful_transmissions[]: List to store the successful transmission times for each station.
    Network State:
        medium_busy: Boolean flag indicating if the medium is currently busy transmitting a frame.
3. Simulation Logic
    Initialize a clock: Start from slot 0 and iterate through each time slot until reaching the total time slots.

    For each time slot:

        Check if medium is busy:
            If busy, stations sense the medium, and no new transmissions start.
            If idle, a station can attempt to transmit.
        Transmission attempts:
            1-Persistent Protocol:
                If a station has a frame ready and the medium is idle, it transmits immediately.
                Update the medium_busy flag to true.
        Collision Detection:
            If more than one station starts transmitting in the same time slot, a collision occurs.
    Collision Handling:
        Stop all transmitting stations, send a jamming signal (1 slot time), and back off using a random exponential backoff mechanism.
        The involved stations will retry after random time intervals.
    Successful Transmission:
        If only one station is transmitting without collision, it successfully starts transmitting its frame.
        Record the time of successful transmission in successful_transmissions[].
        Set the medium_busy flag for the duration of the frame (based on the maximum frame size).
        Handle backoff and retry: Use exponential backoff for stations that faced a collision to retry transmission.

4. Collision Resolution
    After detecting a collision, each involved station picks a random number from an increasing range of slots (exponential backoff) and waits that many time slots before retrying.
5. Output Results
    After simulating all time slots:
    Print the times at which each station successfully transmitted its frame.
    Optionally, print the number of collisions encountered during the simulation.


K: number of attempts
Tp: max. propagation time
Tfr: avg. transmission time
Tb: backoff time
